# Full Calendar JS Practice

I tried to replicate this repo https://github.com/driftingruby/042-fullcalendar

## Explanation

These gems are used:

```ruby
gem 'bootstrap-sass'
gem 'fullcalendar-rails'
gem 'momentjs-rails'
gem 'simple_form'
```
Bootstrap sass adds Sass version of the bootstrap.
 fullcalendar-rails is a wrapper for [fullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/) . momentjs-rails is a js library for parsing, validating and displaying dates in JS. Simple form is alternative to form_for for rendering forms.
